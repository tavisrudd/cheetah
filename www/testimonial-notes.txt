My graphist and me found it excellent, fast, clear, simple, stable: Pythonic!

We found the others engines too verbose, more perlish ;-)

Like python, the best is to try somes engines, you will see quickly wich
one you need. First, like everybody, i did my own engine, but Cheetah
was finaly a better wheel !

I use it to generate html, latex and xml

Definately one of my favorite benefits of Cheetah Templates, since it
also makes it very easy to create a library of widgets this way.

Alex Martelli on Cheetah being used by non-programmers

But suppose your design intention is different -- you want your
templates to be maintained by NON-programmers, people which DO
have problems understanding the differences between the above
distinct concepts!  In Cheetah, the above constructs would be
    $myobject.func
    $myobject.index
    $myobject.attr
i.e., totally polymorphic.  The Cheetah designer, on the basis of
a LOT of experience trying to have non-programmers maintain
templates, believe this extreme polymorphism makes things VERY
much easier for non-programmers

Cheetah, OTOH, is a serious contender for the
"best of breed" Python templating utility (at least when templates
need to be maintained by non-programmers).

Speaking as the author of YAPTU -- YAPTU is a neat little toy, but Cheetah
is a truly powerful system, particularly if your needs coincide with those
it was designed for (e.g., make it feasible for non-programmers to edit the
templates).  I'd suggest looking into Cheetah (or other powerful systems --
Cheetah looks very good to me, but I don't come close to knowing them
all!-), maybe unless you happen to be in a peculiar niche (e.g., if you
must bundle your templating system with a small app, and you don't need too
much in terms of raw power, YAPTU's tiny size may be a plus).

 The elegance of the Cheetah way is how they map Python code
to placeholders. Every method and every field of an object can
be addressed in a Cheetah template.

Another great bonus of Spyce is that it can work with Cheetah,
the one templating system which I felt like I could live with.

But a real templating system is something else again.  I've now
personally dumped YAPTU usage and, after careful examination of
all the various offerings around, switched to Cheetah instead.

Give Cheetah a try.  You won't regret it.

If this is to work, in my opinion, (and by "work" I mean be successful
enough to challenge Rails), then Cheetah must be enabled as an equal
templating language to Kid (at least).  Kevin, you don't know me, but I
dare make this post for the good of Python. Kid may be technically
superior in every way to Cheetah (I don't know), but is the least
popular choice you made for TurboGears. Cheetah is a lot more popular.

People with a strong PHP background absolutely love Cheetah for being Smarty, but much, much better.

> I've seen nothing in the Python world that compares to Smarty templates

I am using Smarty and I know it very well, but compiled Cheetah Templates
(http://www.cheetahtemplates.org) with its inheritance approach is much
powerfull and easier to use than Smarty.

But, the problem is PHP itself has so many bad features that I prefer
rather Python to PHP. And I like Cheetah's inheritence aproach because it
is scales very well for complicated web pages. I can develop internet
application much faster using Python (e.g. using application, very cool and
pythonic Cherry2) and Cheetah. And because extending templates using OO
techniques is tthe feature I like, I would rather choose Cheetach than ZPT,
SimleTAL, Nevow and similar solutions.

I find working with Cheetah / Webware / Python
substantially faster ( for me! ), in development. I came from Taglibs / JSP (
Tomcat / WebLogic? / JRun ) / XML ( XSP via Cocoon ) / Java. Personal preference
is to stick with Cheetah / Webware template applications, spitting out reportlab
PDF ... but hey they can't ( currently ) support your request of XML to PDF, or
XML to HTML, but I find it easier to work with Cheetah templates than XML / XSLT
transformations. Personal preference only.

Cheetah is very nice. Good code even!

What's especially nice about Python -- and I knew this would happen -- is that
that huge hack I had to do to get Smarty to do what I wanted is completely taken
care of with Python's operator overloading mixed with Cheetah's flexibility.

I'm going to like working in Python.

It's true; XSLT isn't the be-all, end-all of templating and transformation
systems. If you use Python, consider instead Cheetah, a template engine based on
Python. Andrew Glover demonstrates its simplicity and power for producing text
in all kinds of formats.
...
Cheetah is an extremely effective Python-powered template engine that can
generate any text-based format. Cheetah's impressive yet simple template
language (based on Python) can yield the most complex of documents
...
Cheetah is surprisingly simple to use

................
The FEAR development team
http://fear.sourceforge.net/docs/latest/guide/Build.html#id2550573

Cheetah has successfully been introduced as a replacement for the overweight XSL
Templates for code generation. Despite the power of XSL (and notably XPath
expressions), code generation is better suited to Cheetah as templates are much
easier to implement and manage.

................


I'm enamored with Cheetah (did anyone get the significance of the name Mombo?)  What would I lose by switching away?

This just might be a deal breaker...  ;-)

Note: I invested a half hour here and a half hour there over the course of a week to produce what I currently have.  I'm not particularly emotionally attached to it... in another few weeks I just might decide to pursue yet another technology and/or programming language.
