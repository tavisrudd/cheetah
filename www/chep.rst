Cheetah Enhancement Proposals
=============================

The concept of the **Cheetah Enhancement Proposal** is similar to the 
`Python Enhancement Proposal <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_ in that 
they are used to outline the future development of Cheetah as both a 
language and a framework.
