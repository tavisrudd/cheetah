**Note to Windows users:** You should install the compiled version of Cheetah's 
NameMapper. It is dramatically faster than the pure Python version, in the source
tree you can find compiled versions for Python 2.4: namemapper.pyd2.4, 
Python 2.5: namemapper.pyd2.5. Install it wherever your system puts 
Cheetah/NameMapper.py. Strip the version numbers off the filename.
