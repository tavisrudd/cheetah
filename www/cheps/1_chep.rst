Abstract
--------
One can consider the basis for all CHEP documents to be 
modeled after `PEP #1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_, 
for this reason you should refer to `PEP #1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_
for the true CHEP "purpose and guidelines" instead of them being 
enumerated here (and duplicated).
