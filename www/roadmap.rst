Cheetah Roadmap
===============

Cheetah v2.2
------------
The first release in the v2.2 series (*v2.2.0*) introduced an overhaul of 
Cheetah's string handling to convert everything internally to use `unicode()`
objects instead of encoded string buffers. 

The subsequent releases in the v2.2 series are planned to have a number of 
important upgrades to Cheetah's infrastructure:

* Built-in Django support
* Cleaner code generation 
* Finish and document #defmacro support

Cheetah v2.3
------------
*still in planning*

The third major series in the Cheetah 2 line of releases will have one focal point, **performance**

Cheetah v3.0
------------
*still in planning*

Cheetah 3000 will be the seminal milestone for running Cheetah on Python 3.0
