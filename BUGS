Compiler forgets commas
=======================
@@TR: This is not a bug.  Python and Cheetah's syntax requires commas.

# Affects Cheetah 0.9.14, CVS and possibly earlier.
# - fix bug in Parser.getDefArgList() that is mucking up lists where the comma has
#   been forgotten:
# 
#   > #cache timer='.5m' id='cache1'
#   > This is a cached region.  $voom
#   > #end cache
#   > 
#   > the error is:
#   > 
#   > "/local/opt/Python/lib/python2.2/site-packages/Webware/Cheetah/Compiler.py",
#   > line 102, in genCacheInfoFromArgList
#   >     val = self.genTimeInterval(val)
#   >   File
#   > "/local/opt/Python/lib/python2.2/site-packages/Webware/Cheetah/Compiler.py",
#   > line 75, in genTimeInterval
#   >     interval = float(timeString)*60
#   > ValueError: invalid literal for float(): .5m' id'cache1
#   > 
#   > 
#   > Running under pdb shows that Parser.getDefArgList() returned:
#   > "30m' id'cache1" .
