Dict method bug
---------------
Do not use placeholder names identical to Python dict methods, or Cheetah will
return the wrong value.  The most notorious names are $update, $keys, $values,
$items.  A complete list is at http://docs.python.org/lib/typesmapping.html.
Note that future versions of Python may add dict methods.  This bug is
difficult to fix given Cheetah's NameMapper, so it will remain around for a
long time.  (MO 2006/02/11)
