0.9.8 (not released yet)
  - Added package ./src/Tools/ for contributed classes/functions/packages not
    necessary to run Cheetah.  The first such class is RecursiveNull.py by Ian
    Bicking.  Added package Cheetah.Tools to list in ./setup.py . (MO)
  - Template.__init__ keyword arg 'searchList': no longer has to be a tuple.  It
    may be a list or any type that that Python's 'tuple' function accepts. (MO)
  - Template.__init__ new keyword arg 'file': this may be a filename or file
    object to read the Template Definition from.  If you use this, you must not
    pass a Template Definition string also.  New instance variables 
    ._fileName and ._fileMtime are set if a filename was passed; otherwise they
    are None. (MO)
  - CodeGenerator new function 'varNotFound_KeyError': raises KeyError if a
    placeholder name is missing when filling the template.  Disabled by default.
    (MO)
  - Template.getUnknowns (new method): returns a list of Placeholder Names
    missing in the Search List. (MO)
  - made changes to Template.py, CodeGenerator.py, PlaceholderProcessor.py,
    and TagProcessor.py to enable customization of the placeholderStartToken so 
    it can be set to any character sequence, rather than just the default '$'.
    This is configurable by the Template setting 'placeholderStartToken' (TR)
  - fixed a small bug in PlaceholderProcessor.processTag() that prevented
    static caching (i.e. $*) of a value containing ''' style quotes

  - fixed the relative path problem with #include when using Cheetah with WebKit
    (TR)
  - implemented the #stop directive (TR)

    #includes from being visible at the top level (TR)
  - fixed a bug in the handling of the setting 'useAutocalling' (TR)
  - fixed some bugs in the handling of macros (TR)
  - completed the transition to nested template #includes (TR)

    (TR)
