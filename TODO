Cheetah TODO list
-----------------

* If you are working on a task please put your initials at the end of the
  description

* When a task is completed please remember to note it in the CHANGES file

Languague Specification
================================================================================

- decide if #extends should continue to work with multiple inheritance or if we
  should delegate multiple inheritance (mixins, etc.) to pure Python base
  classes.

- revisit parsed #include directives.  Are they necessary at all??
  (This is a rhetorical question.  They are necessary.  However, the
  Users' Guide needs better examples about when and when not to use
  #include.  Also, consider making '#include' do a raw include, and
  something else do a parsed include ('#include parsed', '#include cheetah'?),
  so that users get parsing only if they explicitly request it.

- finish the #cache directive's varyBy keyword

- write a formalized grammar for Cheetah in BNF 


Implementation
================================================================================

- implement the automatic importing behaviour for the #extends directive

- redesign and implement the Servlet Factory for Webware so the #extend
  directive will work with .tmpl files as well as .py files.  This will require
  a custom import method using python import hooks.

- implement the #cache directive's varyBy keyword

- split 'cheetah compile' function into two.  'cheetah compile' converts
  *.tmpl -> *.py and eliminates the -w switch.  Another function does 
  whatever 'cheetah compile -w' is supposed to do (*.tmpl -> *.html somehow).
  Audit 'cheetah compile' for bugs and unclear code.

Test Suite
================================================================================
- test cases for the SkeletonPage framework
- add cases that test the cheetah-compile script
- add cases that test the integration with WebKit

Documentation
================================================================================
- more examples in the Webware section (MO)
- more examples/advice all over the Users' Guide about recommended/
  non-recommended strategies (MO)
- developers' guide (MO)
- beginners guide
- quick reference for template maintainers (MO - someday)
- HOWTOs (somebody offered to make some)

Website
================================================================================
- automate the documentation update 
- See if we can get WebKit working on Sourceforge...

Examples
================================================================================
- create some non-html code generation examples
  - SQL
  - LaTeX
  - form email
