Cheetah TODO list
-----------------


* If you are working on a task please put your initials at the end of the
  description

* When a task is completed please change its - to an ! and move it to the bottom
  of the list.

Languague Specification
================================================================================
- firm up the list of features/syntax that are not subject to change
- firm up the NamedValueAccess syntax (along with new test cases)

Implementation
================================================================================
- design and implement the new parser we've been discussing
- reimplement the #include directive so it monitors for changes to 
  the included files
- redesign and implement the Servlet Factory for Webware so the #extend directive
  will work with .tmpl files as well as .py files
- make sure that all the #directives that have start and end tags are
  implemented in such a way that they won't cause 'maximum recursion' limit
  errors if their content block is long.  Simple regexes won't cut it in these 
  cases.

Test Suite
================================================================================
- write script that will run the test cases with both Python 2.0 and 2.1
- independent suite of test cases for NameMapper 
- test cases for the PSP plugin
- test cases for the SkeletonPage framework

Documentation
================================================================================
- add the list of what's stable and what's not to the 'How Mature is Cheetah'
  section
- finish all the empty sections
- flesh out the 'Quick Tutorial' in the 'Getting Started' section
- add the glossary
- add an 'Information for Developers' Section
- add examples to the Examples section

Website
================================================================================
- automate the documentation update (including regenerating the learn.html page)
- add links to the CVS + some instructions
- See if we can get WebKit working on Sourceforge...

Examples
================================================================================
- create some non-html code generation examples

Packaging
================================================================================
- Consider moving SettingsManager.py and NameMapper.py into the 
  third_party_packages dir and making setup_all.py the main install script
! make 'setup.py sdist_docs' generate the update docs by executing the Makefile
