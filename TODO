Cheetah TODO list
-----------------

* If you are working on a task please put your initials at the end of the
  description

* When a task is completed please remember to note it in the CHANGES file

Languague Specification
================================================================================
- firm up the list of features/syntax that are not subject to change

Implementation
================================================================================
- reimplement the #include directive so it monitors for changes to 
  the included files
- redesign and implement the Servlet Factory for Webware so the #extend directive
  will work with .tmpl files as well as .py files
- make sure that all the #directives that have start and end tags are
  implemented in such a way that they won't cause 'maximum recursion' limit
  errors if their content block is long.  Simple regexes won't cut it in these 
  cases.

Test Suite
================================================================================
- write script that will run the test cases with both Python 2.0 and 2.1
- independent suite of test cases for NameMapper 
- test cases for the PSP plugin
- test cases for the SkeletonPage framework

Documentation
================================================================================
- finish all the empty sections (MO)
- add examples to the Examples section (MO)

Website
================================================================================
- automate the documentation update (including regenerating the learn.html page)
- See if we can get WebKit working on Sourceforge...

Examples
================================================================================
- create some non-html code generation examples

Packaging
================================================================================
- Consider moving SettingsManager.py and NameMapper.py into the 
  third_party_packages dir and making setup_all.py the main install script
