This document is not written yet.  It is intended to accomplish the following:

** A sample small .tmpl file and its corresponding .py template module.

** Show how cheetah-compile translates placeholders into Python, as well as
caching, filter, the other directives, and comments.

** Show how placeholders which are local/global/builtin variables get
translated to bare variable names, while other placeholders are turned into a
searchList lookup.  This is what '\$' does: besides marking the beginning of a
placeholder, it intelligently converts it to one or the other.

** List all the methods accessible via 'self'.  (Some of this may belong in the
Users' Guide.)

** Describe how to commit changes to CVS (assuming you have a login/password),
and how to run the test suite beforehand.

** Describe how Cheetah is packaged in distutils format, and how the regression
test suite works.

** History of Cheetah (including the WebOnions image).

** Design decisions and tradeoffs that have been made.

** How to build the documentation.  Why LaTeX, a minimum LaTeX reference, etc.

** Show where you can omit the '\$' and where you can't.

** Two files placeholders.tex and safeDelegation.tex contain material to be
incorporated into this guide.
