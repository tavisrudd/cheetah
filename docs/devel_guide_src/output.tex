\subsection{\#echo}
\label{output.echo}

The template:
\begin{verbatim}
Here is my #echo ', '.join(['silly']*5) # example
\end{verbatim}

The output:
\begin{verbatim}
Here is my silly, silly, silly, silly, silly example
\end{verbatim}

The generated code:
\begin{verbatim}
write('Here is my ')
write(filter(', '.join(['silly']*5) ))
write(' example\n')
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#silent}
\label{output.silent}

The template:
\begin{verbatim}
Here is my #silent ', '.join(['silly']*5) # example
\end{verbatim}

The output:
\begin{verbatim}
Here is my  example
\end{verbatim}

The generated code:
\begin{verbatim}
        write('Here is my ')
        ', '.join(['silly']*5) 
        write(' example\n')
\end{verbatim}
