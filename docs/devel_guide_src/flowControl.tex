\subsection{\#for}
\label{flowControl.for}

The template:
\begin{verbatim}
#for $i in $range(10)
$i #slurp
#end for
\end{verbatim}

The output:
\begin{verbatim}
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
\end{verbatim}

The generated code:
\begin{verbatim}
for i in range(10):
    write(filter(i)) # generated from '$i' at line 2, col 1.
    write(' ')
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#repeat}
\label{flowControl.repeat}

The template:
\begin{verbatim}
#repeat 3
My bonnie lies over the ocean
#end repeat
O, bring back my bonnie to me!
\end{verbatim}

The output:
\begin{verbatim}
My bonnie lies over the ocean
My bonnie lies over the ocean
My bonnie lies over the ocean
O, bring back my bonnie to me!
\end{verbatim}
(OK, so the second line should be ``sea'' instead of ``ocean''.)

The generated code:
\begin{verbatim}
for i in range( 3):
    write('My bonnie lies over the ocean\n')
write('O, bring back my bonnie to me!\n')

I am alive!
\end{verbatim}

The generated code:
\begin{verbatim}
alive = True
while alive:
    write('I am alive!\n')
    alive = False
\end{verbatim}
