To build the Cheetah documentation, you need the 'mkhowto' program from
the Python source distribution.  So:

1) Get the Python source distribution and unpack it in some directory.

2) Edit the Cheetah documentation's Makefile and change PYTHONSRC to
point to the top-level directory of your Python source distribution.

3) Run 'make'.
