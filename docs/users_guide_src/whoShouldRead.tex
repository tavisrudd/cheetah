\section{Who should read this Guide?}

This Users' Guide provides a complete technical overview and reference for the
Cheetah template system.  Knowledge of Python and object-orientated programming
is assumed.  A gentler introduction for template maintainers who don't know
Python will be written later, along with a Developers' Guide explaining
Cheetah's internals.

This Guide also contains examples of integrating Cheetah with Webware for
Python.  You will have to learn Webware from its own documentation in order to
build a Webware + Cheetah site.
