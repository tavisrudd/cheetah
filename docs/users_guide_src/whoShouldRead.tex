\section{Who should read this Guide?}

This Users' Guide provides a complete technical overview and reference for the
Cheetah template system.  Knowledge of Python and object-orientated programming
is assumed.  If you want a gentler introduction to Cheetah you should start with
the Cheetah Beginners' Guide (which doesn't exist yet).

This Guide also contains examples of integrating Cheetah with Webware for
Python.  You will have to learn Webware from its own documentation in order to
build a Webware + Cheetah site.
