\section{Imports, Inheritance, Declarations and Assignments}
\label{inheritanceEtc}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#import and \#from directives}
\label{inheritanceEtc.extend}

The \code{\#import} and \code{\#from} directives is used to import Python
modules or stuff from inside modules.  The syntax is identical to the import
syntax in Python.  Imported modules are visible globally to all methods in the
generated Python class.

\begin{verbatim}
#import math
#import math as mathModule
#from math import sin, cos
#from math import sin as _sin
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#extends}
\label{inheritanceEtc.extends}

The \code{\#extends} directive is used to specify the base classes that the
generated servlet class should inherit from.  It is equivalent to PSP's
\code{``@page extends=''} directive.

\begin{verbatim}
#from Cheetah.Templates.SkeletonPage import SkeletonPage
#extends SkeletonPage
\end{verbatim}

Multiple inheritance is allowed, provided that the first base class is a
subclass of Cheetah.Template.Template:

\begin{verbatim}
#from Cheetah.Templates.SkeletonPage import SkeletonPage
#from MyMixin import MyMixin
#extends SkeletonPage, MyMixin
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#implements}
\label{inheritanceEtc.def}

The \code{\#implements} directive is used specify the name of the method that a
template implements.  It is equivalent to PSP's \code{@page method=} directive.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#set}
\label{inheritanceEtc.set}

\code{\#set} is used for run-time creation of, and assignment to, local
variables.  \code{\#set \$var = EXPRESSION}. The expression may be any Python
expression. Remember to preface variable names with \$, unless it is part of an
intermediate result in a list comprehension.

Here are some examples:
\begin{verbatim}
#set $size = $length * 1096
#set $buffer = $size + 1096
#set $area = $length * $width
#set $namesList = ['Mo','Larry','Curly']
\end{verbatim}

It is probably most useful in conjunction with the \code{\#if} directive, but
remember that more complex logical routines should be coded in Python, not in
Cheetah!
\begin{verbatim}
#if $size > 1500
  #set $adj = 'large'
#else
  #set $adj = 'small'
#end if
\end{verbatim}

\code{\#set global} is used for run-time creation of, and assignment to, global
variables. \code{\#set global \$var = EXPRESSION}. Global variables set in this
manner are visible to all methods of the template class and all methods of
included templates.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#def}
\label{inheritanceEtc.def}

The \code{\#def} directive is used to define new methods of the generated Python
class.  It is roughly analogous to Python's \code{def} statement.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\#block ... \#end block}
\label{inheritanceEtc.block}

The \code{\#block} directive allows you to delimit sections of your template
that can be selectively reimplemented by sub-classes of the template.  It is
very useful for selectively changing part of a template without having to
copy-paste-and-edit the entire thing.  The output from a template definition
that uses blocks will be identical to the output from the same template with the 
\code{\#block and \#end block} tags removed. 

\begin{verbatim}
#block [blockName] 
[block contents] 
#end block [blockName]

#block testBlock
Text in the contents 
area of the block directive
#if $testIt
$getFoo() 
#end if
#end block testBlock
\end{verbatim}

\code{\#block} directives can be nested to any depth.

\begin{verbatim}
#block outerBlock
Outer block contents 

#block innerBlock1
inner block1 contents 
#end block innerBlock1

#block innerBlock2
inner block2 contents 
#end block innerBlock2

#end block outerBlock
\end{verbatim}

Like methods defined with \code{\#def}, blocks are compiled into methods of the
generated Python class and can be reimplemented in subclasses using the
\code{\#def} directive.
