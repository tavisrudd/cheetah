\subsection{What is Cheetah?}
\label{intro.whatIs}

Cheetah is a Python-powered template engine and code generator.  It may be used
as a standalone utility or combined with other tools.  Cheetah has
many potential uses, but web developers looking for a viable alternative to ASP,
JSP, PHP and PSP are expected to be its principle user group.

Cheetah:
\begin{itemize}        
\item generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any
     other text-based format.
     
\item cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code.  This leads
     to highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures; faster
     development time; and HTML and program code that is easier to understand
     and maintain. It is particularly well suited for team efforts.
     
\item blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template language
     that non-programmers can understand.
     
\item gives template writers full access in their templates to any Python data
     structure, module, function, object, or method.
     
\item makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to
     templates that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates.
     One template can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of
     it.
     
\item provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can dramatically
     improve the performance of a dynamic website.
     
\item compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.
\end{itemize}   

Cheetah integrates tightly with {\bf Webware for Python}
(\url{http://webware.sourceforge.net/}): a Python-powered application server and
persistent servlet framework. Webware provides automatic session, cookie, and
user management and can be used with almost any operating-system, web server, or
database. Through Python, it works with XML, SOAP, XML-RPC, CORBA, COM, DCOM,
LDAP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, SSL, etc.. Python supports structured exception handling,
threading, object serialization, unicode, string internationalization, advanced
cryptography and more. It can also be extended with code and libraries written
in C, C++, Java and other languages.

Like Python, Cheetah and Webware are Open Source software and are supported by
active user communities.  Together, they are a powerful and elegant framework
for building dynamic web sites. 

Like its namesake, Cheetah is fast, flexible and powerful.

\subsection{What is the philosophy behind Cheetah?}
\label{intro.philosophy}

Cheetah's design was guided by these principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Python for the back end, Cheetah for the front end.  Cheetah was
     designed to complement Python, not replace it.
     
\item Cheetah's core syntax should be easy for non-programmers to learn.
          
\item Cheetah should make code reuse easy by providing an object-oriented
     interface to templates that is accessible from Python code or other
     Cheetah templates.
     
\item Python objects, functions, and other data structures should be fully
     accessible in Cheetah.
       
\item Cheetah should provide flow control and error handling.  Logic
     that belongs in the front end shouldn't be relegated to the 
     back end simply because it's complex.

\item It should be easy to {\bf separate} content, graphic design, and program
     code, but also easy to {\bf integrate} them.

     A clean separation makes it easier for a team of content writers,
     HTML/graphic designers, and programmers to work together without stepping
     on each other's toes and polluting each other's work.  The HTML framework
     and the content it contains are two separate things, and analytical
     calculations (program code) is a third thing.  Each team member should be
     able to concentrate on their specialty and to implement their changes
     without having to go through one of the others (i.e., the dreaded
     ``webmaster bottleneck'').
     
     While it should be easy to develop content, graphics and program
     code separately, it should be easy to integrate them together into a 
     website.  In particular, it should be easy:

     \begin{itemize}
     \item for {\bf programmers} to create reusable components and functions
          that are accessible and understandable to designers.
     \item for {\bf designers} to mark out placeholders for content and 
          dynamic components in their templates.
     \item for {\bf designers} to soft-code aspects of their design that are
          either repeated in several places or are subject to change.
     \item for {\bf designers} to reuse and extend existing templates and thus
          minimize duplication of effort and code.
     \item and, of course, for {\bf content writers} to use the templates that
          designers have created.
     \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Give me an example!}
\label{intro.whatIs}

Here's a very simple example that illustrates some of Cheetah's basic syntax:

\begin{verbatim}

<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE>$title</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<TABLE>
#for $client in $clients
<TR>
<TD>$client.surname, $client.firstname</TD>
<TD><A HREF="mailto:$client.email">$client.email</A></TD>
</TR>
#end for
</TABLE>

</BODY>
</HTML>
\end{verbatim}

Compare this with PSP:

\begin{verbatim}
<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE><%=title%></TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<TABLE>
<% for client in clients: %>
<TR>
<TD><%=client['surname']%>, <%=client['firstname']%></TD>
<TD><A HREF="mailto:<%=client['email']%>"><%=client['email']%></A></TD>
</TR>
<%end%>
</TABLE>

</BODY>
</HTML>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Who developed Cheetah?}
\label{intro.developers}

Cheetah is one of several templating frameworks that grew out of a `templates'
thread on the Webware For Python email list.  Tavis Rudd, Mike Orr, Chuck
Esterbrook, and Ian Bicking are the core developers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How mature is Cheetah?}
\label{intro.mature}

Cheetah is alpha software as some aspects of its design are still subject to
change and the Users' Guide is incomplete.  We plan to release a stable version
later in 2001.

Here's a summary of known issues and aspects of the design that are in flux:
\begin{itemize}
\item \#include'd templates currently share the searchList of the main Template.
     This behaviour might be changed.
\item Python list comprehensions confuse Cheetah's parser if you put \$ prefixes
     on local vars.  The work-around is to leave the \$ off.  This limitation is
     rather obscure so there are no plans to fix this in the short term.  Let us
     know if this affects you.
\end{itemize}

The syntax and usage directions described throughout the rest of this guide are
stable unless noted otherwise.

The Cheetah wiki is becoming an increasingly popular place to list examples of
Cheetah in use, provide cookbook tips for solving various problems, and
brainstorm ideas for future versions of Cheetah.

\subsection{How can I contribute?}
\label{intro.contribute}

Cheetah is the work of many volunteers.  If you use Cheetah please share your
experiences, tricks, customizations, and frustrations.

\subsubsection{Bug reports and patches}

If you think there is a bug in Cheetah, send a message to the email list
with the following information:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a description of what you were trying to do and what happened
\item all tracebacks and error output
\item your version of Cheetah
\item your version of Python
\item your operating system
\item whether you have changed anything in the Cheetah installation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example sites and tutorials}
If you're developing a website with Cheetah, please send a link to the
email list so we can keep track of Cheetah sites.  Also, if you discover
new and interesting ways to use Cheetah please share your experience and
write a quick tutorial about your technique.

\subsubsection{Template libraries and function libraries}
We hope to build up a framework of Template libraries (see section
\ref{libraries.templates}) to distribute with Cheetah and would appreciate any
contributions.

\subsubsection{Test cases}
Cheetah is packaged with a regression testing suite that is run with each
new release to ensure that everything is working as expected and that recent
changes haven't broken anything.  The test cases are in the Cheetah.Tests
module.  If you find a reproduceable bug please consider writing a test case
that will pass only when the bug is fixed.  Send any new test cases to the email
list with the subject-line ``new test case for Cheetah.''

\subsubsection{Publicity}
Help spread the word ... recommend it to others, write articles about it, etc.
