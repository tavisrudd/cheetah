Cheetah Documentation TODO
--------------------------

Cheetah FAQ
===============================================================================
A place for specific questions & answers for troubleshooting.  Some questions
may duplicate material in the Users' Guide, but some paragraphs in the UG will
be moved to the FAQ.
- Why am I getting a NotFound error?  I put my variable in the searchList!
- Why is my template output empty?
- Why are my $property, $file, ... placeholders misbehaving?

Users' Guide:
===============================================================================
- 200+ e-mails in MO's mailbox regarding possible doc updates.
- more examples in the Webware section (EL)
- more examples/advice all over the Users' Guide about recommended/
  non-recommended strategies (MO)

Developers' Guide:
===============================================================================
- Finish. (MO)

Quick Reference Guide: 
===============================================================================
Cheat sheet on Cheetah syntax and usage.  (MO but not soon)

Beginners' Guide: 
===============================================================================
Written for somebody who has to maintain templates but
doesn't know Python.  Looking for a writer, somebody who trains such 
maintainers and knows what their needs are.  To get the correct LaTeX
structure, copy users_guide.tex and one of its chapters, and modify as
necessary.  


HOWTOs:
=======
Somebody offered to write some HOWTOs on specialized topics.  Who was it?

BNF:
====
- write a formalized grammar for Cheetah in BNF.  MO partly did in
a Developer's Guide appendix.  Essentially, the directives still need
to be done, and a proofreading of the rest.  Move to separate text file and
find somebody to finish it.
