\section{The Template Definition Language}

% This chapter is for any information related to the TDL as a whole.
% Since the vocabulary page already says the TDL consists of $P and #D,
% and the details are fully explained in the next three chapters
% ("Placeholder Tags", "Directive Tags", "Functions and Macros"), I don't
% know what if anything needs to go in this chapter.
