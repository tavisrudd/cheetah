%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Requirements}
Cheetah requires Python release 2.0 or greater and should run on any
operating system that Python 2.0 runs on.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Installation}

To install Cheetah for a single user:
\begin{enumerate}
\item copy the 'src' sub-directory to a directory called 'Cheetah' that is in the
     user's PYTHON_PATH

\end{enumerate}

To install Cheetah for system-wide use:
\begin{enumerate}
\item on POSIX systems (AIX, Solaris, Linux, IRIX, etc.) become the 'root' user
     and run: python ./setup.py install
     
\item On non-POSIX systems, such as Windows NT, login as an administrator and
     type this at the command-line:  python setup.py install
\end{enumerate}


On POSIX systems, the system-wide installation will also install the Cheetah's
command-line compiler program, TScompile, to a system-wide executable path such as
/usr/local/bin.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing your installation}
You can run the test suite to insure that your installation is correct by
following these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item CD into the directory ./Cheetah   
\item type: \code{python Tests.py} 
\end{enumerate}

If any of the tests fail please send a message to the email list with a copy of
the test output and the following details about your installation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item your version of Cheetah
\item your version of Python
\item your operating system
\item whether you have changed anything in the Cheetah installation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quickstart tutorial}
This tutorial briefly introduces the basic usage of Cheetah.  See the
following chapters for more detailed explanations.  

{\bf This tutorial will be fleshed out further at later date.} 

The core of Cheetah is the \code{Template} class in the \code{Cheetah.Template}
module. The following example shows how to use the \code{Template} class from an
interactive Python session. Lines prefixed with \code{>>>} and \code{...} are
user input.  The remaining lines are Python output.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from Cheetah.Template import Template
>>> templateDef = """
... <HTML>
... <HEAD><TITLE>$title</TITLE></HEAD>
... <BODY>
... $contents
... </BODY>
... </HTML>"""
>>> nameSpace = {'title': 'Hello World Example', 'contents': 'Hello World!'}
>>> templateObj = Template(templateDef, nameSpace)
>>> print templateObj
 
<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE>Hello World Example</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
Hello World!
</BODY>
</HTML>
>>> print templateObj  # templateObj can be printed as many times as you need
 
<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE>Hello World Example</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
Hello World!
</BODY>
</HTML>

\end{verbatim}
