\paragraph*{The gist}
Cheetah is open source, but products developed with Cheetah or derived
from Cheetah may be open source or closed source.

(@@MO If this licence is identical to the MIT license, let's say so.  That will
make it easier for distributors/aggregators to classify the product.)

\paragraph*{Legal terms}

Orr, Ian Bicking, Chuck Esterbrook, JJ Behrens.

(@@MO Who is the current development team?  Chuck and Ian have not been major
