<p> Cheetah is the work of many volunteers.  If you use Cheetah, share

list</a>.

<h3>Bug reports and patches</h3>

<p>
If you think there is a bug in Cheetah, send a message to the email list
with the following information:
</p>

<p>
<OL>
<LI>a description of what you were trying to do and what happened
</LI>
<LI>all tracebacks and error output
</LI>
<LI>your version of Cheetah

<h3>Example sites and tutorials</h3>
<p>
If you're developing a website with Cheetah, please send a link to the
email list so we can keep track of Cheetah sites.  Also, if you discover
new and interesting ways to use Cheetah please share your experience and
write a quick tutorial about your technique.
</p>

<h3>Macro libraries</h3> 
<p>
We hope to build up a framework of macros
libraries (see the Users Guide) to distribute with Cheetah and would
appreciate any contributions.
</p>


<h3>Test cases</h3>
<p>
Cheetah is packaged with a regression testing suite that is run with each
new release to ensure that everything is working as expected and that recent
changes haven't broken anything.  The test cases are in the Cheetah.Tests
module.  If you find a reproduceable bug please consider writing a test case
that will pass only when the bug is fixed.  Send any new test cases to the email
list with the subject-line ``new test case for Cheetah.''
</p>

<h3>Publicity</h3>
<p>
Help spread the word ... recommend it to others, write articles about it, etc.
